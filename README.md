<p>Why do people create different web frameworks? It's because everyone thinks in a different way, and develops things differently. For me - it's simplicity. I enjoy developing applications when I am being productive with my time, and solving problems worth solving rather than trying to configure and setup environments on different machines. I plan to create a framework that allows me to easily create the essentials required for a project, and then build up from there.</p>

<p>The things I think are essential are:</p>

+ Easy configuration
+ Easy database configuration
+ OAuth implemented and easy to use
